			<h1>The Power of Poke</h1>
			
			<p>In video games, the concept of poke damage is a common thread across many games that offer combat. While this damage may seem very weak, given the ammount of damage it does per instance seems negligible, it can easily add up over time. Disregarding this massive source is a dangerous situation when utilized to the fullest.</p>
			
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			
			<p>For those unaware of the concept or just those who haven't heard of it, poke damage refers to damage that is given without the intent to commit to a fight. It's the game equivalent of quite literally poking someone, before stepping back before the receiver of the poke gets after you for annoying them. This damage usually is not very much, but easily will annoy and harass the foe before you engage into a fight. A good way to look at poke is to compare it to the opposite of direct damage. The two both have advantages, but knowing which can be effective gives you a step up above your foe.
			<br><br>
			For the comparisons, I'll use 2 characters from Heroes of the Storm, Blizzard's Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA).</p>

			<p>The characters I will use are Valla and Lunara.</p>
			
			<h2>Valla</h2>

			<p>Valla is one of the game's highly iconic damage dealers. While not having much HP at any stage of the game, her damage is hard to outclass when she gets going. Her damage is all frontloaded, doing damage directly and burning through the enemy's health should they not be able to deal with her.
			<br><br>
			Valla's damage is based on a stacking mechanic which can increase her damage per hit by up to 80%. The data values are here in this table, all for level 1:</p>
			
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>Stacks</th>
					<th>Damage Per Hit</th>
					<th>Damage Per Second</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>0</td>
					<td>78</td>
					<td>130.26</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>1</td>
					<td>84.24</td>
					<td>140.68</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>2</td>
					<td>90.48</td>
					<td>151.10</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>3</td>
					<td>96.72</td>
					<td>161.52</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>4</td>
					<td>102.96</td>
					<td>171.94</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>5</td>
					<td>109.2</td>
					<td>182.36</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>6</td>
					<td>115.44</td>
					<td>192.78</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>7</td>
					<td>121.68</td>
					<td>203.21</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>8</td>
					<td>127.92</td>
					<td>213.63</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>9</td>
					<td>134.16</td>
					<td>224.05</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>10</td>
					<td>140.4</td>
					<td>234.468</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Of course, raw numbers do not make a whole lot of sense, but consider that Valla has a health pool of 1324 at level 1. Given this, if you account for her gaining stacks as she goes, she can take herself out in 12 attacks, or 13 if you count the tiny health regen. That isn't very long, especially with how long fights last in these kinds of games. This should show how much impact direct damage can do, and that's before abilites are mentioned, which only add to the value that these numbers hold.</p>
			<h2>Lunara</h2>
			
			<p><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AgQ3T3IzXFk/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="A wallpaper depicting the hero, Lunara." width="840" height="480"></p>

			<p>Lunara, on the other hand, uses a more hands off style. Her damage has some on the front, and does extra damage over 3 seconds, stacking up to 9 seconds of extra damage. This makes her damage values a bit deceptive in how they work. Her damage values when attacking directly go:</p>
			
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>Attacks</th>
					<th>Attack Damage</th>
					<th>Poison Damage</th>
					<th>Total Damage</th>
					<th>Damage Per Second</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>1</td>
					<td>93.6</td>
					<td>106.08</td>
					<td>199.68</td>
					<td>221.64</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>2</td>
					<td>187.2</td>
					<td>212.16</td>
					<td>399.36</td>
					<td>221.64</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>3</td>
					<td>280.8</td>
					<td>318.24</td>
					<td>599.04</td>
					<td>221.64</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>4</td>
					<td>374.4</td>
					<td>353.6</td>
					<td>728</td>
					<td>202.02</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>5</td>
					<td>468</td>
					<td>388.96</td>
					<td>856.96</td>
					<td>190.25</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>6</td>
					<td>561.6</td>
					<td>424.32</td>
					<td>1114.88</td>
					<td>182.39</td>
				</tr>

			<p>Lunara's damage values will, even at first glance, look a lot lower than Valla's. Even the poison seems underwhelming, as the ammount it does falls off very quickly as she hits the limit of her stacking ability. If you check the percentage of damage the poison does, it stays at a nice 53% early on, then keeps dropping from there, eventually bottoming out at around 26.5%. What reason would there be to then take the poison if you could just have more damage?</p>
			
			<h2>Poke</h2>
			
			<p>The reason that you would want Lunara's modified damage is not for the poison in a fight. Far from it, her poison acts too slowly to properly damage in a fight, as the chart shows. But if you instead just attack every so often with only a couple basics, the damage will stack up a bit more. Instead of Valla, who wants to get in on a fight and do direct damage to an enemy, Lunara instead seeks to wear down the enemy from afar and keep their health below the maximum so that when the fight begins, her team has the advantage and can do their job easier. This is the actual power of poke. Poke is not designed to directly defeat the enemy, rather annoy and damage them from afar until you go in, at which point the damage is not as mandatory.</p>
